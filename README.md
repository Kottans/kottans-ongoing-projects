# Kottans: the ongoing projects

This repo is dedicated to tracking
+ ongoing proposals from fellow kottans or just regular bystander about any kind of improvements
+ progress and links to other parts of Kottans' Magic Land™ in which courses, events, fun/useful projects are brewed
+ list of collaborators/contributors and projects/events that we want to emphasize

## How to make sense of things?

You can be on the 'collaborators' side and use [waffle board](https://waffle.io/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/join). Or you can just go straight to the [big list of things](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/issues).

Issues you will find there might be using following group of tags:
+ [Lifecycle](#lifecycle)
+ [Type of Item](#type-of-item)

### Lifecycle

To indicate state of items through lifecycle, following tags can be used:
+ opened issue, no 'lifecycle' tag (those used in bullet points below) – proposed issue
+ opened issue, [in consideration](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/in%20consideration) tag – issue that moved on to the following stage, there's some interest / people offering to do it
+ opened issue, [in progress](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/in%20progress) tag – issue that moved on to the following stage, there's some work done in that direction
+ closed issue, no 'lifecycle' tag – issue is done or closed because of due date
+ closed issue, [frozen](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afrozen) tag – not enough interest/manpower to take it up for time being – move to frozen.

#### How do things progress through these?

We would discuss issues on the [Monthly Meeting](#monthly-retrospective). Depending on the issue type, following things might happen:

+ Proposed issue. Not even in 'agenda' for the monthly meeting, unless it hangs in proposed more than 2 months. In that case might be moved to frozen or just closed if it's an invitation to something.
+ In consideration. After further discussion on Monthly meeting, might advance to 'in progress' or degrade to proposed issue / frozen
+ In progress. Work in progress. Might get into done or frozen state from here
+ Frozen issue might get back to proposed / in consideration stage

### Type of Item

Proposal item might be generally classified into:
+ [Kottans Course](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/kottans%20course). This would include proposal to run (new) course in (some/new) city.
+ [Kottans Event](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/kottans%20event). Event under Kottans™ umbrella. Kottans hackathon, workshop, meetup, etc. Kottans should be invited, but event shouldn't be restricting to be kottans-exclusive (yet it may).
+ [Other event](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/other%20event). Yet it has to do something with open-source, charity and or other areas that kottans might be interested to help with. TODO: discuss, whether help with running something like [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io) can be placed here
+ [Kottans Improvement](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/kottans%20improvement). Has to deal with something regarding our tools, workflow, chores, etc. 'Work on Site', 'Post on dou.ua', 'Print and distribute stickers' might be labeled under this.
+ [Kottans Project](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/kottans%20project). Deals with things kottans build for greater good, yet our own. 'Create tool for registration', 'create automated tests for all Ruby homeworks', etc.
+ [Other Project](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/other%20project). Invite kottans to hack on something, preferably open-source and something you are not making money off.

#### Proposal Format

TODO: add issue template.
Consider adding 'due date', 'qty of people needed', 'skills needed' fields.

## Monthly retrospective

Items that are getting to the next upcoming retrospective are easy to figure out: everything that is 'in consideration' prior to the meeting will get in. Can assign Milestone to issues and use that filter to review things. Previous meetings items / decisions should be recorded in [Past retrospectives](PAST_RETROSPECTIVES.md).

### Technical side of things: TODO – discuss

Possible tools to use:
+ skype – free for up to 300 users, can do screenshare, might create a 'join' link and place in readme, but generally, a chat will be hanging around (might just disable messages and only leave calls), needs invite / add – needs app
+ Google Hangouts - free, but up to 10 people, can create a named group with permalink, can record calls directly to youtube – can do using browser, but might need plugin
+ set up own [mumble](http://www.mumble.com/) – good audio, but no video – needs app, link to server would be same, people would require some upfront work to join
+ [Ekiga](http://www.ekiga.org/)? But might take some effort to setup on Mac  
+ ? roll your own based on webRTC ?
