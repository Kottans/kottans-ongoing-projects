# Kottans: the ongoing projects

This repo is dedicated to tracking
+ ongoing proposals from fellow kottans or just regular bystander about any kind of improvements
+ progress and links to other parts of Kottans' Magic Land™ in which courses, events, fun/useful projects are brewed
+ list of collaborators/contributors and projects/events that we want to emphasize

## How to make sense of things?

You can be on the 'collaborators' side and use [waffle board](https://waffle.io/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/join). Or you can just go straight to the [big list of things](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/issues).

Issues you will find there might be using following group of tags:
+ [Lifecycle](#lifecycle)
+ [Type of Item](#type-of-item)

### Lifecycle

To indicate state of items through lifecycle, following tags can be used:
+ opened issue, no 'lifecycle' tag (those used in bullet points below) – proposed issue
+ opened issue, [in consideration](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/in%20consideration) tag – issue that moved on to the following stage, there's some interest / people offering to do it
+ opened issue, [in progress](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/in%20progress) tag – issue that moved on to the following stage, there's some work done in that direction
+ closed issue, no 'lifecycle' tag – issue is done or closed because of due date
+ closed issue, [frozen](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afrozen) tag – not enough interest/manpower to take it up for time being – move to frozen.

#### How do things progress through these?

We would discuss issues on the [Monthly Meeting](#monthly-retrospective). Depending on the issue type, following things might happen:

+ Proposed issue. Not even in 'agenda' for the monthly meeting, unless it hangs in proposed more than 2 months. In that case might be moved to frozen or just closed if it's an invitation to something.
+ In consideration. After further discussion on Monthly meeting, might advance to 'in progress' or degrade to proposed issue / frozen
+ In progress. Work in progress. Might get into done or frozen state from here
+ Frozen issue might get back to proposed / in consideration stage

### Type of Item

Proposal item might be generally classified into:
+ [Kottans Course](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/kottans%20course). This would include proposal to run (new) course in (some/new) city.
+ [Kottans Event](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/kottans%20event). Event under Kottans™ umbrella. Kottans hackathon, workshop, meetup, etc. Kottans should be invited, but event shouldn't be restricting to be kottans-exclusive (yet it may).
+ [Other event](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/other%20event). Yet it has to do something with open-source, charity and or other areas that kottans might be interested to help with.
+ [Kottans Improvement](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/kottans%20improvement). Has to deal with something regarding our tools, workflow, chores, etc. 'Work on Site', 'Post on dou.ua', 'Print and distribute stickers' might be labeled under this.
+ [Kottans Project](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/kottans%20project). Deals with things kottans build for greater good, yet our own. 'Create tool for registration', 'create automated tests for all Ruby homeworks', etc.
+ [Other Project](https://github.com/sudodoki/kottans-ongoing-projects/labels/other%20project). Invite kottans to hack on something, preferably open-source and something you are not making money off.

### Proposal Format

So, typical issue should contain:
  1. Subject (short sentence describing initiative).
  2. Term/duration (when is it going to take place or how long it might last).
  3. Keywords:
    + Online/offline
    + City
    + Technologies
  4. What do we propose and what do we need to reach the goal?
Consider adding 'due date', 'qty of people needed', 'skills needed' fields.

## Monthly retrospective

Items that are getting to the next upcoming retrospective are easy to figure out: everything that is 'in consideration' prior to the meeting will get in. Can assign Milestone to issues and use that filter to review things. Previous meetings items / decisions should be recorded in [Past retrospectives](past_retrospectives).

Will be conducted in skype. To join the group [follow the link](https://join.skype.com/jwWS1iFFegGZ).  
It will be done every month, last Saturday of the month at 19.00 unless noted otherwise.  
There's going to be assigned master of ceremony who is going to

1. formulate agenda prior to the call based on items in corresponding Milestone
2. start the call
3. go through items
4. take notes and post them afterwards in [Past Retrospectives](past_retrospectives)
