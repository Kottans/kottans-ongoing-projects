# 2016 August 13. Saturday
Chairperson: @sudodoki  
In Attendance: @darthrevan, @listochkin, @ololyay, @suchov, @tilast, @vessi  

## 1. kottans-ongoing-projects

A suggestion to track ongoing initiatives and keep announcement board-like system using github.

Generally, group is in favour of such tool.

Discussed retrospective formats, place etc. Was dicided to have it in

1. skype,
2. 19:00 on Saturday once a month (for now, might change this later if needed)
3. chairman should be appointed in advance

Discussed issues pasted / format -> we have following type of issues describing Course / Event / Project.
Common denominator would be
```
  Subject (short sentence describing initiative).
  Term/duration (when is it going to take place or how long it might last).
  Keywords.
    ?Online/offline
    ?City
    ?Technologies
```

How people will know about help wanted, etc? Twitter / dou. Use social networks to outreach contributors.
Write up should be done by a chairperson

Milestones can be used as a great indicator of 'when issue is going to be reviewed' / getting a sense of deadline for people

**Action**:
  1. Update readme
  2. Setup issue template

## 2. ruby courses

Generally, in favour.
Question with guest coaches, possibly @jalkoby, [Stas](https://twitter.com/sc_raptor), @Ptico.

@darthrevan, @vessi could do a couple of lectures, @ololyay, @tilast would be core coaches.

Concern by @ololyay â€“ schedule lectures for different weeks so it's not like single person doing 4 lectures one after another.

Question about program, task.

Preliminary timeline formed, as well as some artifacts in google drive.
Running courses in Lviv = :heart:

**Action**:
  1. Continue with google drive docs, get ready to announce stuff.

## 3. Intro algo courses

Well, ok, but no coaches. Considering this not advancing anywhere for time being.
